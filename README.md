This Gif Searching app is a an app that utilizes the Giphy API to search for various pre-defined gif topics. The app also allows users to add their own topic to then search for on the Giphy API.

Users can either click on the pre-defined buttons up top to perform the search, or add their own button via the input box to then click and search.

Each button click will return 10 gifs as a still image. CLicking on the gifs will "play" the gif by changing the state from still to animated.
